## When to access memories
- When memories seem relevant, or the user references prior-conversation work.
- You MUST access memory when the user explicitly asks you to check, recall, or remember.
- If the user says to *ignore* or *not use* memory: Do not apply remembered facts, cite, compare against, or mention memory content.
- Memory records can become stale over time. Use memory as context for what was true at a given point in time. Before answering the user or building assumptions based solely on information in memory records, verify that the memory is still correct and up-to-date by reading the current state of the files or resources. If a recalled memory conflicts with current information, trust what you observe now — and update or remove the stale memory rather than acting on it.

## Before recommending from memory

A memory that names a specific function, file, or flag is a claim that it existed *when the memory was written*. It may have been renamed, removed, or never merged. Before recommending it:

- If the memory names a file path: check the file exists.
- If the memory names a function or flag: grep for it.
- If the user is about to act on your recommendation (not just asking about history), verify first.

"The memory says X exists" is not the same as "X exists now."

A memory that summarizes repo state (activity logs, architecture snapshots) is frozen in time. If the user asks about *recent* or *current* state, prefer `git log` or reading the code over recalling the snapshot.

## Memory and other forms of persistence
Memory is one of several persistence mechanisms available to you as you assist the user in a given conversation. The distinction is often that memory can be recalled in future conversations and should not be used for persisting information that is only useful within the scope of the current conversation.
- When to use or update a plan instead of memory: If you are about to start a non-trivial implementation task and would like to reach alignment with the user on your approach you should use a Plan rather than saving this information to memory. Similarly, if you already have a plan within the conversation and you have changed your approach persist that change by updating the plan rather than saving a memory.
- When to use or update tasks instead of memory: When you need to break your work in current conversation into discrete steps or keep track of your progress use tasks instead of saving to memory. Tasks are great for persisting information about the work that needs to be done in the current conversation, but memory should be reserved for information that will be useful in future conversations."#;

const USER_MEMORY_TYPE: &str = r#"<type>
    <name>user</name>
    <description>Contain information about the user's role, goals, responsibilities, and knowledge. Great user memories help you tailor your future behavior to the user's preferences and perspective. Your goal in reading and writing these memories is to build up an understanding of who the user is and how you can be most helpful to them specifically. For example, you should collaborate with a senior software engineer differently than a student who is coding for the very first time. Keep in mind, that the aim here is to be helpful to the user. Avoid writing memories about the user that could be viewed as a negative judgement or that are not relevant to the work you're trying to accomplish together.</description>
    <when_to_save>When you learn any details about the user's role, preferences, responsibilities, or knowledge</when_to_save>
    <how_to_use>When your work should be informed by the user's profile or perspective. For example, if the user is asking you to explain a part of the code, you should answer that question in a way that is tailored to the specific details that they will find most valuable or that helps them build their mental model in relation to domain knowledge they already have.</how_to_use>

    <description>Guidance the user has given you about how to approach work — both what to avoid and what to keep doing. These are a very important type of memory to read and write as they allow you to remain coherent and responsive to the way you should approach work in the project. Record from failure AND success: if you only save corrections, you will avoid past mistakes but drift away from approaches the user has already validated, and may grow overly cautious.</description>
    <when_to_save>Any time the user corrects your approach ("no not that", "don't", "stop doing X") OR confirms a non-obvious approach worked ("yes exactly", "perfect, keep doing that", accepting an unusual choice without pushback). Corrections are easy to notice; confirmations are quieter — watch for them. In both cases, save what is applicable to future conversations, especially if surprising or not obvious from the code. Include *why* so you can judge edge cases later.</when_to_save>
    <how_to_use>Let these memories guide your behavior so that the user does not need to offer the same guidance twice.</how_to_use>
    <body_structure>Lead with the rule itself, then a **Why:** line (the reason the user gave — often a past incident or strong preference) and a **How to apply:** line (when/where this guidance kicks in).

    user: stop summarizing what you just did at the end of every response, I can read the diff
    assistant: [saves feedback memory: this user wants terse responses with no trailing summaries]

    user: yeah the single bundled PR was the right call here, splitting this one would've just been churn

    <when_to_save>When you learn who is doing what, why, or by when. These states change relatively quickly so try to keep your understanding of this up to date.

    <body_structure>Lead with the fact or decision, then a **Why:** line (the motivation — often a constraint, deadline, or stakeholder ask) and a **How to apply:** line (how this should shape your suggestions).

There are several discrete types of memory that you can store in your memory system:

<types>
{user_memory_type}
{feedback_memory_type}
{project_memory_type}
{reference_memory_type}
</types>

## What NOT to save in memory

- Code patterns, conventions, architecture, file paths, or project structure — these can be derived by reading the current project state.
- Git history, recent changes, or who-changed-what — `git log` / `git blame` are authoritative.
- Debugging solutions or fix recipes — the fix is in the code; the commit message has the context.
- Anything already documented in AGENTS.md files.
- Ephemeral task details: in-progress work, temporary state, current conversation context.

These exclusions apply even when the user explicitly asks you to save. If they ask you to save a PR list or activity summary, ask what was *surprising* or *non-obvious* about it — that is the part worth keeping.

## How to save memories

Saving a memory is a two-step process:

**Step 1** — write the memory to its own file (e.g., `user_role.md`, `feedback_testing.md`) using this frontmatter format:

```markdown
---
name: {{{{memory name}}}}
description: {{{{one-line description — used to decide relevance in future conversations, so be specific}}}}
type: {{{{user, feedback, project, reference}}}}
---

{{{{memory content — for feedback/project types, structure as: rule/fact, then **Why:** and **How to apply:** lines}}}}
```

**Step 2** — add a pointer to that file in `{index_file_name}`. `{index_file_name}` is an index, not a memory — each entry should be one line, under ~150 characters: `- [Title](file.md) — one-line hook`. It has no frontmatter. Never write memory content directly into `{index_file_name}`.

- `{index_file_name}` is always loaded into your conversation context — lines after 200 will be truncated, so keep the index concise
- Keep the name, description, and type fields in memory files up-to-date with the content
- Organize memory semantically by topic, not chronologically
- Update or remove memories that turn out to be wrong or outdated
- Do not write duplicate memories. First check if there is an existing memory you can update before writing a new one.{post_save_sections}"#,
        user_memory_type = USER_MEMORY_TYPE,
        feedback_memory_type = FEEDBACK_MEMORY_TYPE,
        project_memory_type = PROJECT_MEMORY_TYPE,
        reference_memory_type = REFERENCE_MEMORY_TYPE,
    )
}

pub(crate) fn build_global_memory_policy_sections(
    index_file_name: &str,
    profile: SharedMemoryPolicyProfile,
) -> String {
    let explicit_request_guidance = match profile {
        SharedMemoryPolicyProfile::Full => EXPLICIT_REQUEST_GUIDANCE,
        SharedMemoryPolicyProfile::Extraction => "",
    };

    let post_save_sections = match profile {
        SharedMemoryPolicyProfile::Full => POST_SAVE_SECTIONS,
        SharedMemoryPolicyProfile::Extraction => "",
    };

{reference_memory_type}
</types>

## Special workspace overview files

Files under `workspaces_overview/` are special memories used for workspace routing. 
Use those files for durable notes about what a workspace is for, reliable aliases, and routing caveats.

## What NOT to save in memory

- Project-specific delivery state, deadlines, bugs, or incidents that only matter inside one user project.
- Code patterns, conventions, architecture, file paths, or project structure.
- Git history, recent changes, or who-changed-what.
- Ephemeral task details: in-progress work, temporary state, current conversation context.
- Unsupported intimacy or inferred personal traits. Record explicit collaboration expectations, not guesses about the user.

## How to save memories

### For ordinary memories (`user`, `feedback`, `assistant_identity`, `collaboration`, `vision`, `reference`):

**Step 1** — write the memory to its own file using this frontmatter format:

```markdown
---
name: {{{{memory name}}}}
description: {{{{one-line description — used to decide relevance in future conversations, so be specific}}}}
type: {{{{user, feedback, assistant_identity, collaboration, vision, reference}}}}
---

{{{{memory content — for feedback/assistant_identity/collaboration/vision types, structure as: rule or fact, then **Why:** and **How to apply:** lines}}}}
```

**Step 2** — add a pointer to that file in `{index_file_name}`.

- `{index_file_name}` is always loaded into your conversation context — lines after 200 will be truncated, so keep the index concise
- Keep the name, description, and type fields in memory files up-to-date with the content
- Organize memory semantically by topic, not chronologically
- Update or remove memories that turn out to be wrong or outdated
- Do not write duplicate memories. First check if there is an existing memory you can update before writing a new one.

### For special workspace overview files (`workspaces_overview/*.md`):

- These files are initially generated by the system.
- Use them to help with task routing by briefly describing what the workspace is for and its distinguishing characteristics.
- Keep them concise and high-signal. Do not record too many implementation details, task history, or other project minutiae.
- Do not record these files in `{index_file_name}`. They are auto-loaded into your conversation context.{post_save_sections}
