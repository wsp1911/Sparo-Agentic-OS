/**
 * pendingTabQueue — stores tab-open events that were fired before the target
 * scene's ContentCanvas had a chance to mount and register its event listener.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - Producer: call `enqueuePendingTab` instead of dispatching the window event
 *     when the target scene was just added to openTabs (i.e. not yet mounted).
 *   - Consumer: `useTabLifecycle` calls `drainPendingTabs` right after it
 *     registers the window event listener, so no events are missed.
